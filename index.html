                            <p>
                                I am responsible for the design, implementation and continued development of Cloudreach's Procurement process. Whilst working in Cloudreach's IT team, part of my
                                remit was navigating software and subscription renewals; I quickly identified that no formal Procurement process existed and flagged this to the Finance Director, suggesting
                                where improvements could be made. This resulted in a new process which I have continuously adapted and improved, including a fully systemised implementation of a Procurement
                                module in our FinancialForce instance. This ensures far better control of company spend, better tracking of any accruals and commitments and more accountability for any out
                                of budget spend or lack of adherence to the process.
                            </p>
                                I manage relationships with many of Cloudreach's vendors, owning any complaints or problems, driving them to their associated solutions through effective troubleshooting
                                and leveraging relationships with internal stakeholders and SMEs. I am committed to providing the best service to my internal customers and the vendors that I work with.

                            <div class="subheading mb-2">Cloudreach, an Eviden business</div>
                            <p>
                                In this role I was responsible for supporting a largely technical user base over three continents. This included dealing with access, billing and usage issues across Azure/AWS/GCP,
                                G-Suite administration and Android/Apple mobile device provisioning and support. Coming from a technical support background where bespoke, non-cloud software was prevalent,
                                this role was very challenging and allowed me to dip my toe into the world of cloud computing support.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In addition to the support element of this role, I owned any software and subscription renewals for Cloudreach and analysed monthly spend to identify any potentially redundant
                                subscriptions before terminating these. I initiated, owned and maintained relationships with IT suppliers across eight countries, resulting in Apple relationships in various
                                geographies and Net30 accounts across UK, Europe, USA and Canada.
                            </p>
                                This role allowed me to hit my stride with stakeholder relationship management and segued nicely into my next role as Cloudreach's Procurement Specialist.

                                This aided in developing my ability to prioritise effectively, categorising incidents based on urgency and driving problems to solution through efficient
                                troubleshooting and technical knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I learned how to setup and support video conferences using bespoke AV solutions, resulting in building great relationships with senior partners and external stakeholders.
                            </p>

                            I also helped with the training of new members of staff, creating knowledge articles where appropriate.

                                I leveraged my great customer service experience to provide a stellar service to all Standard Life employees on a 24/7 rota. This was my first IT role,
                                allowing me build my technical knowledge to set a solid foundation for a career within IT.

                            This role was very good at helping build a solid customer service etiquette and equipped me to deal with difficult customers and complaints from early in my career.

                    <p>Outside of work, I love online gaming and playing electric guitar.  I have found gaming to be a great way to meet new people and make new friends.  I run a World of Warcraft guild and have done so for the past three years, with players from
                    all over Europe on my roster.  I find it mentally stimulating to work together and tackle end-game, high-difficulty content as a group, and it's very rewarding when all the hard work pays off and we defeat that next boss.  As for the guitar, I've
                     played for around 20 years and would consider myself to be an intermediate player, but mostly enjoy playing in my bedroom, and generally high-speed things that the music lovers of today would typically not enjoy! </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Besides gaming and playing guitar, I have a five year old rescue dog from Romania called Kira who my wife and I are absolutely besotted with.  We always like finding new places to explore and will typically spend each weekend trekking around a reservoir 
                    or venturing through a forest.</p>
